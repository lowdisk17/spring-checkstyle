# spring-checkstyle
A simple project to kickstart your spring boot and checkstyle journey

Note: 
In testing run the application by using any idea of your choice (example VSCode).

Two ways to test checkstyle
1. Using mvn clean build command
   - this command you can check the checkstyle issues and will be presented via cli error
2. Using mvn site
   - this command will generate site folder under target folder, which contains checkstyle.html containing the results of the checkstyle verification
